<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Worm Gears Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Enveloping Worm Gears</li><li>Double-Enveloping Worm Gears</li><li>Non-Enveloping Worm Gears</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The worm gears market is categorized into three main types: single-enveloping, double-enveloping, and non-enveloping worm gears. Single-enveloping worm gears feature a single thread that wraps around the worm, providing moderate efficiency and compact design. Double-enveloping worm gears, with two threads, offer higher efficiency and greater load capacity due to their enhanced contact surface. Non-enveloping worm gears lack this wrapping, resulting in lower efficiency but simpler configuration and ease of manufacturing. Each type serves distinct applications based on performance and design requirements.</p></p>
