<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Auto-transfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Pump Transfusion Device</li><li>Off-Pump Transfusion Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiopulmonary auto-transfusion system market is divided into two main types: on-pump and off-pump transfusion devices. On-pump transfusion devices are utilized during surgical procedures where blood is collected and reinfused while the heart-lung machine is operational, providing continuous circulation. In contrast, off-pump transfusion devices are employed in surgeries that do not involve cardiopulmonary bypass, allowing for blood recovery and retransfusion without the use of a heart-lung machine. These systems enhance patient safety and optimize blood usage in various medical procedures.</p></p>
